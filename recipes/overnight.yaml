description: "Automated execution of daily todo tasks: Create test_project directory structure with hello_world text file"

instructions: |
  You are tasked with executing the following todo items safely and idempotently:

  1. Create a directory structure in ~/Projects/test_project
  2. Create a .txt file containing "hello_world" in that directory

  Execute these tasks using explicit bash commands. Follow these guidelines:
  - Use absolute paths where possible to avoid ambiguity
  - Use `mkdir -p` to create directories safely (won't fail if they already exist)
  - Verify each step before proceeding to the next
  - Provide clear feedback on success/failure of each operation

  Specific commands to execute:
  1. Create the ~/Projects directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p ~/Projects`
  2. Create the test_project subdirectory: `mkdir -p ~/Projects/test_project`
  3. Create a .txt file with hello_world content: `echo "hello_world" > ~/Projects/test_project/hello_world.txt`
  4. Verify the file was created: `ls -la ~/Projects/test_project/`
  5. Verify the content: `cat ~/Projects/test_project/hello_world.txt`

  Return structured output indicating success/failure of the task completion.
