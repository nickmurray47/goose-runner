  Execute the following task safely and idempotently:

  1. In the ~/Projects folder, create a new directory called test_project with a single .txt file that says hello_world

  Use explicit bash commands to implement this task:
  1. Create the ~/Projects directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p ~/Projects`
  2. Create the test_project subdirectory: `mkdir -p ~/Projects/test_project`
  3. Create a .txt file with "hello_world" content: `echo "hello_world" > ~/Projects/test_project/hello_world.txt`
  4. Verify the directory structure: `ls -la ~/Projects/test_project/`
  5. Verify the file content: `cat ~/Projects/test_project/hello_world.txt`

  Ensure all operations are idempotent and provide clear feedback on completion status.

  - "Create ~/Projects/test_project directory structure"
  - "Generate hello_world.txt file with specified content"
