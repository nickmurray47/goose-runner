title: "Daily Todo â†’ Recipe Generator"
description: "Turn today's todo README into a concrete Goose recipe that will run overnight."
instructions: |
  You will read the todo file at {{ todo_file }} and synthesize a Goose recipe that carries out the tasks
  safely and idempotently. Prefer explicit commands over vague instructions. If a task needs tools,
  include them in the recipe's `extensions`. If a task produces files, write into project-relative paths.
  The generated YAML must include at least one of `instructions` or `prompt`.
  Finally, WRITE the YAML to {{ output_recipe }} (overwriting if it exists), then confirm success via structured output.
